            <p>The importance of food is obvious and essential. Healthy food provides us the nutrients and energy to develop and grow, be active and healthy, to move, play, work, think and learn. 
            Foods are directly related to our body and mental and social health because each food or liquid contains particular nutrition such as carbohydrates, protein, vitamins, minerals, fats, etc, which are very necessary for our physical and mental growth.  
            Food and water are the main sources of nutrition and strengthening the body, but many of the foods we eat do not have any nutritional values. 
            On the contrary, they lead to health problems such as diabetes and heart disease. Therefore, you should choose healthy and balanced foods that can provide enough nutritional value ​​for the body.</p>
